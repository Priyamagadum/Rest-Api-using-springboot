# Project Architecture and Design

This project follows a simple Spring Boot architecture with the following components:

1. **Controller (`CandidateController`):
   - Handles incoming HTTP requests.
   - Maps HTTP requests to corresponding methods in the `CandidateService`.

2. **Model (`Candidate`):
   - Represents the candidate entity with name and vote count.

3. **Service (`CandidateService`):
   - Implements business logic.
   - Uses local variables to store data.

4. **Application Entry Point (`YourApplication`):
   - Contains the main method to start the Spring Boot application.
